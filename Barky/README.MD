# Barky

Barky is inspired by Dane Hillard's Bark example of an application that demonstrates some basic software engineering principles such as:

- Separation of concerns
- Loose Coupling
- Inheritance
- Extensibility
- Abstraction
- Refactoring

This repository is an extension of Dane's example to also include testing.

# Layered Architecture

At a basic level, the architecture is designed with a layered strategy to include the following common/typical elements:

- **Presentation Layer** (will be a module called barky.py here)
- **Business Logic Layer** (will be a module called commands.py here)
- **Presistence Layer** (will be a module called database.py here)

# Bare Bones Approach

## Persistence

We will take a bare bones approach and connect directly to a sqlite database.

The [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) tool will be useful to inspect the data and manage the database file.

The initial database wil consist of a table called `bookmarks`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookmarks
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    date_added TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

# Barky Refactored

Dane Hillard's code focused on a command-line interface, but we will refactor that code, in a new branch, to do the following:

1. Replace the custom data handling (the DatabaseManager module) with the [SQLAlchemy O/RM](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
   1. Replace the existing
   1. Complete the implicit and explicit promises of the existing API
2. Replace the CLI as the exclusive interface in favor of a web-based REST API
    1. achieves looser coupling
3. Improve architecture:
   1. SOLID
   2. Repository Pattern and Unit of Work (understand how SQLAlchemy is really doing this)
   3. Dependency injection
